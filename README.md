### My Quiz App

For further practice after the bootcamp, I decided to build a quiz app. Tech stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Styled Components. Deployment: Vercel.


### Local Development

To work locally, please install the dependencies using `npm i` first.

Run `npm run dev` to start a development server and open the displayed URL in a browser.

Use `npm run test` to run the tests.

### Scripts

You can use the following commands:

- `npm run dev` to start a development server
- `npm run build` to build the project
- `npm run start` to start a production server
- `npm run test` to run the tests
- `npm run lint` to run the linter
